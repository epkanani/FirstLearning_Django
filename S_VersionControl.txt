Using Git to version control my projects and code: 

Getting started:
Pre-requisits: 
    - setup SSH and get ssh key  -
        - (to check whether you have existing keys (public and private)): cmd ls -al ~/.ssh 
        -(create new ssh key for git): cmd  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
        - it will then ask for directory where you want to save your keys (<press enter>) so its saves in the .ssh/ default
        - it will then ask for a password (passphrase) (<I did not enter one>) press enter
        - it will the ask to renter password, just press enter again
        - once its done type cmd: ls  (to see listed files)
        - the .pub is our public key
        - the we want to promote our key to github type: cmd cat <name of .pub>
        - copy and paste the generated file to your github account:
            - >settings
            - > SSH and GPG key 
            - > add new SSH 
            - > save

    - get a github account and create a new repository for where your code will go 

Follow the following cmds to create local git repository that then will be pushed to github:
Intitialzing Git For version control cmd from: https://codemy.com/git
Use code if for the first time setting up:
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"
use code for commiting code in local repository:
    $ git config --global push.default matching
    $ git config --global alias.co checkout
    $ git init
After if we want to add everythig in the current directory into out git directory
    $ git add . (indicates add everything)
    $ git commit -m "<add commit reason>"
pushing the code in the local repository to git hub
for new reporsitry on git hub 
    - need to create new repository 
    - then use the instructions to push the contents to this new repository example: 
        $ git remote add origin https://github.com/epkanani/FirstLearning_Django.git
        $ git branch -M main 
        $ push u- origin main
for future updates in the current development directory: 
    $ git add . (to add everything to the local repo)
    $ git commit -m "<reason for commiting files>"
    $ git push (to push your current changes)
