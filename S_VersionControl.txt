Using Git to version control my projects and code: 

Getting started:
Pre-requisits: 
    - setup SSH and get ssh key  -
        - (to check whether you have existing keys (public and private)): cmd ls -al ~/.ssh 
        -(create new ssh key for git): cmd  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
        - it will then ask for directory where you want to save your keys (<press enter>) so its saves in the .ssh/ default
        - it will then ask for a password (passphrase) (<I did not enter one>) press enter
        - it will the ask to renter password, just press enter again
        - once its done type cmd: ls  (to see listed files)
